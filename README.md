# Eagle-Gaze
A simple AHK script that will help you stick to the 20-20-20 rule.
Every 20 minutes, it will remind you to look 20 meters away for 20 seconds.

## Features
- It is rather light when running (~2 Mb RAM usage), and will just wake every 10 seconds to make its operations
- It will pause when you are away from keyboard for more than 2 minutes
- Only one pop up when its time to relax, then 2 auditive signals to mark the 20 seconds of pause

## How to use
It is written in AHK. I provided the 64 bit executable, but for security reasons, it's always better to use the script directly.
For that you'll need to install [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com).

Of course you can edit it to your preferences.


In passing, take a look at my personal website : [https://natsec.fr](https://natsec.fr)
