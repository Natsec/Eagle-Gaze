# Eagle-Gaze
A simple AHK script that will help you stick to the 20-20-20 rule.
Every 20 minutes, it will remind you to look 20 meters away for 20 seconds.

It is written in AHK. I provided the 64 bit executable, but for security reasons, it's always better to use the script directly.

For that you'll need to install [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com).
